# Portfolio Optimiser
# After entering a date, and stock symbol(s) this program will print
# the optimal allocation of funds to each stock within the portfolio as
# a percentage. A graph is also printed showing the difference in returns
# between the calculated allocation, and an even allocation. The program
# uses the Sharpe ratio to determine which allocation of funds is the most
# optimal taking volatility and returns into account.
